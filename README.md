async fn main() {
    // get prices for the last two days
    let prices = query_prices(
        AwattarZone::Germany,
        Some(chrono::Local::now() - chrono::Duration::days(2)),
        Some(chrono::Local::now()),
    ).await.unwrap();

    for slot in prices {
        println!(
            "{} - {}: {:.02} €/kWh",
            slot.start(),
            slot.end(),
            slot.price_cents_per_mwh() as f32 / 100_000.00
        );
    }
}
```
